# 0-1-Knapsack-Problem-using-Genetic-Algorithm

For the Knapsack problem, we use binary encoding, where every chromosome is a string of bits, 0 or 1. GAs require a fitness function which allocates a score to each chromosome in the current population. Thus, it can calculate how well the solutions are coded and how well they solve the problem
